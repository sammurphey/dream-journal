Plural "Dream" Journal
========

! _WIP_ !

A sort of "blogging" app for recording dreams and/or other events. The app may be used by nt's as well, but was designed specifically for plural systems (ppl with DID / headmates etc). We are building it out to handle system "groups" containing many users, each with their own login and privacy features. Entries may be tied to an individual or the whole system and will display in the appropriate location. 

We will also eventually be adding ways to tag and record locations, tropes, and other recurring dream events for better analysis.

Also u can theme each user's account with different colors lol ofc.

_This project also uses some of Google's Material Design Icons, in: src/icons. Google has released these graphics under the Apache 2.0 license._

I'm not super familiar with licenses, I'll pick an appropriate one when this is done, but just for now take it and do absolutely whatever you want with it. Spin up your own instance with a private SQL server, rewrite it make it better and distribute on ur own! Whatever have fun. Link us if u want but u dont have to.
